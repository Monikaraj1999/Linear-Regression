# Linear Regression Analysis for Boom Bikes
> A US bike-sharing provider called BoomBikes providing bikes for rent, And we need to predict the significant factors which will increase the count of bikes rented using Linear Regression model. So that, the company can give importance to those factors while planning to achieve maximum demand.

## General Information

### What is the background of your project?
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
- So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs.
- They want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- And How well those variables describe the bike demands

## What is the dataset that is being used?
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
### Conclusion 1 from the analysis
- The R-Square value of the Test Data is 0.80, so that 80% of the variation in the predicted variable is explained by the input variables.
- The R-Square value of the Train Data set was 0.8299.
- From R-Sqaured and adj R-Sqaured value of both train and test dataset we could conclude that the above variables can well explain more than 80% of bike demand. 

### Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- Based on final model top three features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand are:
    1.Temperature
    2.Year
    3.Humidity
 - So it recomended to give these variables utmost importance while planning to achieve maximum demand.
 - We have finalised the independent variables which are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. And evaluated how well those variables describe the bike demands.
